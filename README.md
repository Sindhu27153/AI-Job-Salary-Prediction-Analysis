# AI-Job-Salary-Prediction-Analysis
A machine learning project to analyze and predict salaries in AI-related jobs based on various factors such as experience, education, location, and skills.

<h2>Features</h2>

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and engineering

Model training and evaluation

Salary prediction and insights visualization

<h2>Installation</h2>

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-job-salary-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd ai-job-salary-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2>Usage</h2>

Run the analysis using:

python main.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Load and preprocess the AI job salary dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key salary determinants.

Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on historical data.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

Predict salary ranges based on input features such as job title, experience, location, and education level.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
