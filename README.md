pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the analysis using:

python main.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.

How It Works

Load and preprocess the AI job salary dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key salary determinants.

Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on historical data.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

Predict salary ranges based on input features such as job title, experience, location, and education level.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
